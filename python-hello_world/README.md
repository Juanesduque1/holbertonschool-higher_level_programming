# Hello, World
Project done during my **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about variables, basics commands as `print` and handle strings in **Python**.

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-run`](./0-run) | Bash script that runs a Python script file saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. |
| [`1-run_inline`](./1-run_inline) | Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`. |
| [`2-print.py`](./2-print.py) | Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `print`. |
| [`3-print_number.py`](./3-print_number.py) | Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line. |
| [`4-print_float.py`](./4-print_float.py) | Python script that prints the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of two digits. |
| [`5-print_string.py`](./5-print_string.py) | Python script that prints a string stored in the variable `str` three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in `str`, followed by another new line. |
| [`6-concat.py`](./6-concat.py) | Python script that prints `Welcome to Holberton School!` using the variables `str1 = "Holberton"` and `str2 = "School"`. |
| [`7-edges.py`](./7-edges.py) | Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable `word`. |
| [`8-concat_edges.py`](./8-concat_edges.py) | Python script that prints `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals. |
| [`9-easter_egg.py`](./9-easter_egg.py) | Prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line. |
