# If/else, loops, functions
Project done during my **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about if/else statements, loops, range and functions in **Python**.

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-positive_or_negative.py`](./0-positive_or_negative.py) | Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints whether `number` is positive or negative. |
| [`1-last_digit.py`](./1-last_digit.py) | Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and prints its last digit. |
| [`2-print_alphabet.py`](2-print_alphabet.py) | Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |
| [`3-print_alphabt.py`](./3-print_alphabt.py) | Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e`, not followed by a new line. |
| [`4-print_hexa.py`](./4-print_hexa.py) | Python program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and hexadecimal. |
| [`5-print_comb2.py`](./5-print_comb2.py) | Python program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`, separated by `, `. |
| [`6-print_comb3.py`](./6-print_comb3.py) | Python program that prints all possible combinations of two digits, separated by `, `. |
| [`7-islower.py`](./7-islower.py) | Python function that checks for lowercase characters. Return `True` if `c` is lowercase, `False` otherwise. |
| [`8-uppercase.py`](./8-uppercase.py) | Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. |
| [`9-print_last_digit.py`](./9-print_last_digit.py) | Python function that prints the last digit of a number. |
| [`10-add.py`](./10-add.py) | Python function that returns the addition of two integers. |
| [`11-pow.py`](./11-pow.py) | Python function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value. |
| [`12-fizzbuzz.py`](./12-fizzbuzz.py) | Python function that prints the numbers from `1` to `100` followed by a space, following the FizzBuzz pattern. |
