# Import & modules
Project done during my **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about importing functions for their usage and creating modules in Python. Also using the builtin function `dir()` and using command line arguments within Python programs.

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [0-add.py](./0-add.py) | Python program that imports `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3` |
| [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py) | Python program that imports functions from the file [calculator_1.py](./calculator_1.py) and prints the result of the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of `10` and `5`.|
| [2-args.py](2-args.py) | Python program that prints the number of and list of its arguments. |
| [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py) | Python program that prints the result of the addition of all its arguments. |
| [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py) | Python program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`. |
| [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py) | Python program that imorts the variable `a` from the file [variable_load_5.py](./variable_load_5.py) and prints its value. |
